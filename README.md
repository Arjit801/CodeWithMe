# Segment Tree
So, Segment tree is a data structure to that can query and update data for the given range with log(n) time complexity. Some of the usecase of segment tree are: 
Finding min/max element for a subarray.
Find sum of a subarray.
Count the number of elements based on some condition for the given range.

Disadvantages are: 
It takes a lot of space and the code complexity gets increases if the query is very small.

The size of segment tree array must be 4*n it's proof is very vast topic (TBS).
